# How long since [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is just a basic app to track how long since something you did.

The aim of this little project was to try and practice with:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), as static site generator.
- [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com), as UI framework.
- [React Context](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Demo

A live version of this code should be available at [https://agm-dev.ninja/how-long-since-site/](https://agm-dev.ninja/how-long-since-site/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agm-dev/how-long-since.git
